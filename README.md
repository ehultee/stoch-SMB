 Fitting stochastic/noise models to time series of ice sheet surface mass balance

To get you started, this repository includes a conda environment file and a Jupyter notebook guide.
After downloading the repo to your computer, open up a Terminal and navigate to it.  Then enter the following commands:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate stisp
jupyter lab
```

A browser window should open with Jupyter interface, showing the guide.  Please do open issues or get in contact by email 
if you have problems accessing the materials.

Note: as of 31 Mar 2023, the subfolder 'data' includes catchment mean SMB series for all 260 catchments in Greenland,
following our most up to date processing scheme.  This is the data that supports our 2023 submission to GMD.
The folder 'SMBMIP-processed' is legacy and will be changed to an 'archive' folder (for completeness) 
when we can ensure all scripts in the public repository have been updated accordingly.
